\label{cha:evaluation}
For evaluation purposes, 6LoCAN is implemented in the Zephyr RTOS network stack.

\autoref{tab:resources} shows the RAM and ROM demand of the 6LoCAN implementation.
The build is the echo\_server sample application, built on Zephyr 2.2 with 6LoCAN enabled.
It includes the IPv6 network stack, TCP, and UDP.
The sample uses 64 net buffers for each, receiving and sending.
One buffer can hold up to 128 bytes, which results in 8192 bytes for sending and 8192 bytes for sending.
As shown in the table, the 6LoCAN does not add an excessive amount of RAM and ROM.
The sample uses 64 net buffers each, for receiving and sending.
As shown in the table, the 6LoCAN does not add an excessive amount of RAM and ROM.
Most of the RAM is used for the sending and receiving buffers.
The 6LoCAN contexts use 1024 of the 1664 bytes of RAM.
The ROM overhead of 6LoCAN in the entire network stack is only 11.4 \%.

\input{figures/eval_setup}

\autoref{fig:eval_setup} shows the setup used for all evaluated data in this section.
USB is used as a power supply and provides a UART terminal.
The boards are flashed with an application that transfers data when issuing a command over UART.
The boards are connected to the CAN-bus with a CAN-transceiver. One board also has Ethernet, connected to the host.
This Ethernet port serves as the Boarder-Translator.
The Logic-Analyzer is used to determine the exact timing of the frames.

\subsection{Link-Layer Duplicate Address Detection}

\begin{figure}[htp]

        \caption{Link-Layer Duplicate Address Detection Measurement}
        \label{fig:eval_lldad}
\end{figure}

Two boards are programmed with the same fixed address (0x1234) to evaluate the Link-Layer Duplicate Address Detection.
\autoref{fig:eval_lldad} shows a capture of the LLDAD.
The black trace is the CAN\_RX line and therefor shows the logic levels on the bus.
The brown trace is the CAN\_TX line and, therefore, only shows the data sent by the node that issues the LLDAD.
The first CAN frame is the LLDAD request. The identifier used is 0x48d3c0d (DST: 0x1234, SRC (entropy): 0x3C0D) and the RTR bit is set.
The second frame is the response from the other node, already using the same address.
The identifier is 0xf7f9234 (DST: 3DEF, SRC: 0x1234).
The node that caused the address duplication noticed the duplication and disabled the interface.

\subsection{Ping}
This section shows the evaluation of a Ping command.
One board has a fixed address of 0x1234, and the other board has a randomly chosen address.
The logs below show what is going on during the brin up of the interface and pings.

First node with the address 0x1234:

The Ping command:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none, basicstyle=\tiny]
uart:~$ net ping fe80::ff:fe00:1234
PING fe80::ff:fe00:1234
8 bytes from fe80::ff:fe00:1234 to fe80::ff:fe00:314e: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=54 ms
8 bytes from fe80::ff:fe00:1234 to fe80::ff:fe00:314e: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=9 ms
8 bytes from fe80::ff:fe00:1234 to fe80::ff:fe00:314e: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=9 ms
\end{lstlisting}

The first ping takes 45 ms longer than the following two pings.
This additional time is due to the Neighbor Discovery (ND).
The nodes first have to discover the Link-Layer addresses before they can exchange the data.

\end{table}

\autoref{tab:udp_eval} shows the protocol overhead and the time needed to send UDP data packets.
The IPv6 row shows the overhead coming from the IPv6 protocol, and the ISO-TP row shows the overhead coming from the ISO-TP protocol.
If the data would be transferred using raw ISO-TP, eight bytes could be saved. This value is constant, regardless of the packet-size.
If the data would be transferred using raw CAN frames, it would take 16 frames to send 128 bytes and 128 frames for 1024 bytes.

\autoref{fig:udp_128_0_0}is a capture of an UDP transfer with 128 bytes.
It uses the fastest possible parameter set with a BS of zero, which means that there are no additional FC frames to wait for and no separation time.

\autoref{fig:udp_128_0_8} is a capture of an UDP transfer with 128 bytes.
It uses a BS of eight, which means that every eight frames, the sender has to wait for another FC frame with a CTS state. The separation time is zero.

\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:udp_128_5_8} is a capture of an UDP transfer with 128 bytes.
It shows a combination of a BS of eight and a separation time of five ms.
The separation time can, for example, be used to reduce the load on the bus.
